      <h1>Ai Worm</h1>
      <p>
        Hi there! My name is Ai Worm, and I am basically the first official member of Allinventor. Well...
        I say basically because there are others before me, but they are secret members. Shhhh, it's
        supposed to be a seceret. Even though they are required to be added here, they have yet to.
        Something about finding the perfect Alias for their identity. Anyways, they aren't coders so they
        really don't have to have their name added in this particular site. Anyways, I love to code and build
        anything with my hands and mind. I helped create Allinvetor because of a vision we shared. Until the real
        leader decides to make their face known, I am the face of this Organization.
      </p>
      <h3>Why I am I the Face?</h3>
      <p>
        To be honest, there really isn't an official reason. For the most part I have to be the one who has to get
        my face out there to create this Organization publically. They are the ones in charge of making sure things
        run smoothly in the background. They are more like advisers and guardians hoping to guide me to make something
        they would all be happy about. My task is bassically to start creating projects that the community will
        appreciate. So feel free to check out my YouTube Channel, Pateron and many other things that I have and will
        create. All the links will eventually be somewhere on this page lol.
      </p>
      <h3>What do I Create?</h3>
      <p>
        I create what I want to create. Yep, there's really nothing else to it. Apart from the fact that if someone
        has a great idea I also build it, but I give credit. This is what we ask for your name becaues it is the right
        thing to do. I can take credit for building it, and everything else I do. But if the idea isn't mine I wont
        take credit for that part. Plus it makes it even better because someone else wanted something and I was able to
        make it. I just like to have fun and creating brings out the good in me, regardless of what it is. However, I do
        have a few rules on what I create, and why.
      </p>
      <span>What I create...</span>
      <ol>
        <li>can not be used to hurt others physically or emotionally</li>
        <li>must not deprive others of their basic freedoms</li>
        <li>must give as much control as physically possible to others (users)</li>
        <li>must have a failsafe (or more) built in for security</li>
        <li>must fit my personal morals</li>
        <li>must have the potential to inspire or motivate others</li>
        <li><b>must</b> be approved by the code of conduct I created for myself with a score of 75% or higher</li>
      </ol>
