        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to the Allinventor Open-Source Website. This is where you will find a pure collection of projects
          that we are working on. This includes all past projects, whether a success or failure. It's like a record
          of everything we have tried to accomplish. It also includes a quick summary about who we are as an Organization.
          What's more, we also include a quick overview of each member currently in the Organization. They are written
          by the person themselves and is the only place where they will all appear. Some members will wish not to be
          mention in any other place publically, but they are required to add themselves here. However, they don't have
          to use their real names but an Alias if they wish so.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the projects you will also find detailed information about what was trying to be accomplished, and what
          was accomplished. It will also include an official timeline of how things happened, along with every member
          that was involved. It will include basically any and every information about the project, unless we forget.
          It happens, in which case we would hope to fix it soon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before you go, don't forget that if you have any ideas or opinions we are always opened to them. They could
          range from potential fixes or improvements. All the way to new projects and ideas you would like us to create.
          Just email <a href="mailto:allinventor@yahoo.com?Subject=Community%20Project%20Idea" target="_top">
            Allinventor@yahoo.com</a> along with the name you would like us to credit the idea to. If you don't mention
          a name or decided not to. We will simply give credit to the Allinventor Community. Just take note we like to
          make everything opensource unless its an original idea from us that we somehow felt not to. But if that is the
          case, we can guarentee that there will be another opensource alternative to it that we created.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember, "We are bonded by more than blood and mind. We are bonded by heart."
