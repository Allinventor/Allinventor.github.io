      <h1>Project Fabula</h1>
      <h2>A Story Telling Tool for the creative mind</h2>

      <h3>What is it?</h3>
      <p>
        Fabula is meant to be a, "write once and distrubite everywhere as anything" tool/format. In partcialar it is
        meant to be a type of MarkDown that allows people to create a detailed creative story, with a tool that keeps
        track of various objects. A fully fledge version of this tool would include machine learning to aid in speed.
        Imagine creating a story which will later allow you to turn it into a game, movie script, play script,
        visual-novel or even an actual animated movie? This is the real goal of Fabula. It is possible to turn one idea
        into many things, and Fabula is meant to help you achive this.
      </p>
      <h3>How do we plan on accomplishing this?</h3>
      <p>
        Starting with the basics. We first need to create a simple format for a story. This should allow for the author
        to create a title for the page or section. Along with tags for characters, events, actions and places. With these
        tags and some help with machine learning, we hope to be able to create a virtual world that is updated as you
        write your story. It should be able to keep track of a character's actions and where they have been, along with
        descriptions about itself. This information is then used to create various timelines of the character of the whole
        story in general. With enough details provided in the story, or added by the author Fabula should be able to help
        turn the story into what you wanted it to be (a book, movie, script, or game etc.). In a sense, it literally takes
        the time to build the actual world behind the scenes in a way that allows the author to view a "3 Dimensional World"
        of their creation. Sounds easy/hard/impossible right? Machine Learning will really be the key here :). Though it
        is important to allow it to be created without machine learning because this will be its real strength. Human
        readable.
