      <h2>A mobile focused Content Management System</h2>
      <blockquote cite="/">

      <h3>What is it?</h3>
      <p>
        A Content Management System (CMS) allows a user to create a website while being able to edit anything and everything
        directly within the application or by changing a few lines in a file. A simple and quick way to create and maintain
        a website for a business, blog or a landing page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Owl is meant to be a new way to create and maintain a website. It's primary focus is to allow the user to
        maintain their website by creating new pages or changing them through a mobile device. It is meant to be a
        mobile friendly CMS that is fast and responsive. It attempts to do so by focusing on content first, and
        then looks. All while being as SEO (Search Engine Optimization) friendly.
      </p>
      <h3>When will it be available?</h3>
      <p>
        Project Owl is still underdevlopment as I try to create a system that should allow for everything that is
        essential in a CMS system. Creating Pages, Creating Backups, and Chaning Style/Theme.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal is to create a light and heavy version. The light version would be for smaller business, blogs etc.
        Any website that doesn't require many things to be functional, and can be easily maintained through a mobile
        device. The heavy version would be named as another project, which focuses on creating more complex business
        websites that need user accounts and complex components such as learning lessons.
